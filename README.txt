# helloWorld
Creating a very basic open source project with proper open source setup.

Homework 4: (Implementing CI/CD)

Implementation of CI/CD was done with Travis CI.

test.py works with python2.x but not with python3.x

Travis CI tests the build when we push it automoatically. 

In .travis.yml if I change the executions script to test.py, I would see that it fails for python3.x 

In .travis.yml if I change the executions script to test2.py, I would see that it passes for for both - python2.x and python3.x
